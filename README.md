*Peer Review*: Overall the design is excellent, but there are some functionality issues you should address before submission. 
I really enjoy the look of your web app! Super cool icons and fun pops of color for your hover effects! There may be readability issues with the background text for the gameplay pages. I recommend using white text as it offers the best contrast while keeping with your color scheme. Smart use of the image in a modal for the tutorial, its super clear and helpful for understanding gameplay. At the time of review the player versus player mode was not working correctly. The single game, or sudden death, mode did not end. The score never changed from 0 to 0 despite the player turn changing (indicated by the highlighted player banner.) Currently the button for navigating to the pvp best of 5 and best of 7 direct me to the player versus cpu pages with those respective match lengths. Player versus CPU sudden death works perfectly. The Player versus CPU best of 5 forces you to play 5 rounds even if the player wins 3+ rounds, which IS fun, but somewhat confusing since it says best 3/5. The Player versus CPU best 4 out of 7 seems to work perfectly!
